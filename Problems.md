# Plan

I think it is important to write down a plan for the project and the problems that we could enounter. For now I have created a few Paragraphs where we can elaborate stuff. Feel free to add new things.

## Problems

### The program has to be installed by anyone
- Should we set up a meeting with the professor to discuss how to create a program that can be installed by anyone? I don't think we know how to do that. Corman mentioned it last year, but I would like a refresher.
  - I can attend this meeting alone since Johanna will be in Germany and ELisabeth might not want to come here just for a meeting (maybe you can join online)

### Research how to model data

# Johanna
 - token methode (aut.), prediction research
# Elisabeth
- StoreData, Open Data Hub presentation, website page ideas
# Elisa
- getData(), get.data.ParkingData methods, (prediction research)
