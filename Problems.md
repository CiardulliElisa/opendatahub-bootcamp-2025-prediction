# Plan

I think it is important to write down a plan for the project and the problems that we could enounter. For now I have created a few Paragraphs where we can elaborate stuff. Feel free to add new things.

## Problems
### 1. What kind of software can I do?
Any software... It can be a web application, a web component, a backend service, a library, a desktop application, a mobile application, a framework, etc... 
- What should we create?

### 2. The program has to be installed by anyone
- Should we set up a meeting with the professor to discuss how to create a program that can be installed by anyone? I don't think we know how to do that. Corman mentioned it last year, but I would like a refresher.
  - I can attend this meeting alone since Johanna will be in Germany and ELisabeth might not want to come here just for a meeting (maybe you can join online)

## 3. IDE problems
- Are some IDEs better than others for doing this project?
- Are there problems when using different IDEs on the same project. (For now I have created a .gitignore)

## 4. Should we use Maven?
